ALL RIGHTS RESERVED BY LEONARD KEVIN MCGUIRE JR.

This is no problem for any of you non-profits out there. I simply reserved any 
rights that I did not give away (considering GitHub). I plan to come back and
find a more suitable license to prohibit commercial usage. If you are on GitHub
then you already have the right to fork and view the code in this directory that
is covered under this license, which is seperate from the Jingo project.

IF you would like a license for yourself then just send me a mail at kmcg3413@gmail.com, and I will grant you one that would protect you and your work based on my work contained in this directory.

This system does not merge with Jingo, but rather it just runs along side of it, 
and may interface with it in simplistic and common ways.
